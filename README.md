# MySQL-Python-Login-System
> Logging in is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves, and so after I learned about SQL and databases, I decided to combine my python skills and my database skills to create a simple register/login system that I linked up with a Relational Database Management System, to first create a username and password and then test them by loggin in! :ok_hand:
